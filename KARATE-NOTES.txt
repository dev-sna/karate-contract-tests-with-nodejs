NOTES: 
Once we call the read function on a Javascript file from for our Javascript OR .feature 
file, all the variables in that Javascript file become DIRECTLY available in our 
current file. 
Hence while going through the apitest repo one will observe many undeclared variables
being used in a file. All of these variables having been declared in the v2/v3 folders.

The first line of any Javascript file cannot be a comment. Otherwise the parser will throw
a "no variable with name: response" error
